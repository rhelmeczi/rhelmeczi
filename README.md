# Hi there, my name is Kraig. Thanks for visiting my GitHub!

## About Me

* I'm a machine learning engineer and software developer, and I've recently completed a Master's degree in Data Science and Analytics at Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson University).
* I studied Physics in undergrad and finished with the highest average across all faculties in my school, earning a [Governor General's Silver Medal](https://brocku.ca/brock-news/2020/10/physics-grads-earn-governor-general-silver-medals-at-fall-convocation/).
* My thesis was an investigation into the state-of-the-art few-shot learning methods for text classification. We compared the performance of [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co) transformer models and few-shot learning algorithms when applied to training data sets with limited labeled examples.
* In my two year Master's degree I have first authored four publications: two in reinforcement learning and two in natural language processing using few-shot learning. You can check out my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=41uOLbMAAAAJ&hl=en) to view some available pre-prints/publications.

## My Current Work

* I currently work as a machine learning engineer, managing projects from conception through to deployment. In this process I handle
  - Problem conception
  - Problem elaboration
  - Model conception and design
  - Model implemention
  - Data collection, feature engineering, data labeling (including few-shot labeling)
  - Model training
  - Model deployment (i.e., ML Ops), especially via AWS
  - Monitoring of deployments
* In addition to my machine learning work, I also act as an engineer to create user interfaces to create environments where deployed models can be tested by key stakeholders, clients, and by internal staff (often client-facing).

## My Projects

I've engaged in a lot of projects over my 5+ years of development.
Unfortunately, many of my worthwhile projects are contained in private repositories.
While not all of them can be made public, I've been slowly extracting code that I can share with the public.

* A subset of the code from my Master's thesis is available [here](https://github.com/rhelmeczi/few_shot_nlp). This code is used for training NLP models with access to a limited amount of training data.
* You can checkout [this repository](https://github.com/rhelmeczi/itlp-cpomdp) for some of my work on using linear programming for reinforcement learning.
  Our work ultimately resulted in a journal publication, so I've added a small sample of the code there.
  
 ## My Programming Experience
 
 I'm extremely open to learning new systems and languages. I'm a fluent Python developer, but I have a well-established track record of learning new languages with a quick turn around:
 * I was formally trained in Java in undergrad, and learned Kotlin for my own app development project in 2020.
 * I learned Free Pascal to complete my undergraduate thesis.
 * I've been solving problems with Rust since 2020.
 * I learned C to add optimizations to my reinforcement learning projects, as the Python APIs for the linear program solver that we use are slow for our applications.
 * I learned and used NodeJS, Angular, and Javascript in a contract web development and machine learning project to introduce a front-end for clients to manually label training data for model development.
