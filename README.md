# Hi there, my name is Kraig. Thanks for visiting my GitHub!

## About Me

* I'm a data scientist and software developer currently finishing up my Master's in Data Science and Analytics at Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson University).
* I studied Physics in undergrad and finished with the highest average across all faculties in my school, earning a [Governor General's Silver Medal](https://brocku.ca/brock-news/2020/10/physics-grads-earn-governor-general-silver-medals-at-fall-convocation/).
* My thesis is currently an investigation into state-of-the-art few-shot learning methods for text classification. We compare the performance of [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co) transformer models and few-shot learning algorithms when applied to training data sets with limited labeled examples.
* In my two year Master's degree I have first authored four publications: two in reinforcement learning and two in natural language processing using few-shot learning. You can check out my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=41uOLbMAAAAJ&hl=en) to view some available pre-prints (note that three of the publications are currently in press).
* I'm extremely open to learning new systems and languages. I'm a fluent Python developer, but I have a well-established track record of learning new languages with a quick turn around:
  * I was formally trained in Java in undergrad, and learned Kotlin for my own app development project in 2020.
  * I learned Free Pascal to complete my undergraduate thesis.
  * I've been solving problems with Rust since 2020.
  * I learned C to add optimizations to my reinforcement learning projects, as the Python APIs for the linear program solver that we use are slow for our applications.
  * I learned and used NodeJS, Angular, and Javascript in a contract web development and machine learning project to introduce a front-end for clients to manually label training data for model development.

## My Current Plans

* I'm just finishing up my thesis and, if all goes well, I will be finished school at the end of April, 2023.
* I'm currently looking for work as either a machine learning engineer or a software developer. While my thesis is in natural language processing, I have experience in deep learning with neural networks, as well as in reinforcement learning.
